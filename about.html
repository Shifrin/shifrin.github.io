                <div class="col-12 col-md-8">
                    <p>Since 2011, I have joined in a web development company called Incitomedia as a data entry operator
                        and then I had a chance to try web designing and development and that opportunity made me to
                        become a successful web developer and help me to continue my journey into the web development field.</p>
                    <p>Initially I started my development with PHP and WordPress then I moved into the framework such as Yii.
                        And I started to use Yii Framework continuously and become so comfortable with that and I use
                        Yii for web applications till now and I use WordPress mostly for blog based websites
                        or landing page websites like company profile etc.</p>
                    <p class="mb-0">This is my simple story that says how did I grow up in the web development field.
                        I've been actively involved in the web developing & designing community for the last 6 years
                        and therefore I know the all the possibilities nowadays in the field.</p>
