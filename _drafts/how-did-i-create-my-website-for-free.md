Creating a website is not easy is'nt it? But now a days creating websites are made easy 
by the technology and the community. Yes the community helps us to create websites 
for bloggers was made easy by an open source software and for free. Yes for free, that's 
awesome right?

Okay... Let me tell you little secrets, yeah maybe secrets ;) that how did I create this 
website for free. But I spent only for the domain because it can't be free. The website is 
hosted on Github and developed with Jekyll.
