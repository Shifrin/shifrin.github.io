## I’m warmly welcoming you to my blog!

I’m a Web Developer and being more than 6 years in the web development industry with 
hands-on experience in various types of projects personally and officially. 
I’m interested in writing, tech posts from my experience which inspired me to create 
a website. So here it is, writing my very first post as an introduction to my blog.

I have plenty of experience using the Yii Framework and WordPress and therefore my most 
of the posts that I have planned to write belong to those categories. I have several 
experiences in Yii and Yii2 based app developed from scratch to deploy. 
I have used WordPress in several projects including news websites, corporate websites, 
landing pages and sometimes for static websites. And more I'll write about Jekyll, 
GitHub Pages and other general things about web development.

I believe that those experiences will help me to write perfect posts and teach the 
beginners to improve their knowledge at least on specific areas. It will also allow 
developers to share their thoughts by commenting on each post.

I will also write some code snippets that I have used in my projects. The code snippets 
are the small block of reusable code that can be inserted in your functions or working 
files.

I like and welcome your feedback on each post that I publish. Because it will help me to 
learn from you "devs" (friends of developers), it will correct me if I made any mistakes 
and will help to become a perfect tech blogger.

Learning will never end… Thank you for visiting my blog.
