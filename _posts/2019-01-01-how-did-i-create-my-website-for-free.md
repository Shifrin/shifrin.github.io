Creating a website is not easy, isn't it? but by the developer community and the 
technology is made easy. Yes, the developer community helps other developers to create 
free static websites for the purpose of the portfolio, blogging, projects and organization 
sites with their open source contributions. Yes, for free, that's good, right? 
That's the power of open source.

Okay... Let me tell you little secrets, yeah, maybe secrets ;) that how did I create this 
website for free. But you may think about hosting where you can host your website for free. 
It's also possible with Github Pages.

I have used the following free tools or libraries to create my website.

- Jekyll - for the magic :), the static site generator and blog 
- Bootstrap - for the UI design
- Unsplash - for free images
- Font Awesome - for free icons
- Github Pages - for the hosting
- Github - for the repository management & version control
- Grammarly - for the writing

I would like to keep the design as simple as possible and it should be easy to navigate by 
the visitors. Therefore, I have started to create the design on my own from scratch using 
[Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/). The Bootstrap 4 giving us the power of CSS flex 
boxes to easily craft the layout and the alignment of the HTML blocks with the least work 
and responsive as well.

The [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and some of its plugins help me to transfer my crafted 
design into completely a static website with the blog. Yes, Jekyll will transform your plain 
text and block of HTML into a static website and blog. Because it's simple and like a 
file-based CMS. Therefore, you don't need to worry about a database or admin panel to 
manage your content. Jekyll works with Markdown, so you can start your writing easily 
with plain text.

The developers who have a background of PHP and WordPress may think that the Jekyll will be 
hard and don't know Ruby language to work on it. Because the Jekyll is created by Ruby. 
If you have that mentality right a change it. Because you're going to mostly work on the 
front-end side technologies such as HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Trust me, I also had that 
mentality before I started with Jekyll because I'm a PHP developer and if you're 
interested to know more about me you can visit 
[here](https://www.mshifreen.com/about-me/). Apart from that, you're also going to work 
with the [Liquid](https://github.com/Shopify/liquid/wiki) template engine like Twig, 
Blade and Smarty for PHP. So you know how easy it will be when you're using a template 
engine.

One of our simple and basic requirement is when we create websites we need some images to 
visually represent or to get the attention of visitors or at lease to attract the visitors. 
Yes, I do use images and I found [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/) that hosted tons of 
free photos by the community of photographers and I used it. Unsplash offer variety of API 
services to the developers to use those photos easily. And also I used 
[Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) which is offer more than 1000 icons for the icon 
needs.

[Grammarly](https://www.grammarly.com/) is a writing assistance tool that will help you to 
write without spelling and grammar mistakes. I'm not a native English speaker or writer and 
therefore this tool assists me to fix whenever I do mistakes in writing. It's available to 
use as a desktop application, Chrome extension and Office add-ons. They are providing a 
premium service as well for advanced grammar mistakes.

Finally, when the website is ready for the launch, we're going to host it on 
[Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) with the help of a Github repository. So we 
need to create a Github repository for the website. As a good practice, we should 
create two branches which are 'master' the default branch and 'development'. You can use 
the master branch to deploy the website to the Github Pages and the development branch 
will help you to do the development and testing. Whenever you do updates you just need to 
make a `commit` and then `push` it to the development branch and make a pull request and 
merge it into the master branch. That's it the updates will be online.

The resources are not limited only with what I have used or shared here, there are some 
other good alternatives too. But it's completely up to you to choose the right option 
for your needs. I'll write another blog post soon which will guide you through the 
detailed steps to start with the tools & libraries which I have used. Share your thoughts 
below and enjoy your holidays.
